# MobileApplicationProject
Building a simple app using Ionic and Angular that generates random quotes and retrieves data from an API improved my understanding of programming by allowing me to work with front-end technologies such as Angular for building user interfaces, and Ionic for creating cross-platform mobile applications.
As well as this, I was able to learn about the principles of good app design and gain hands-on experience with app development.


### Prerequisites
    • Java 8 or higher
    • Ionic v3
    • Angular 6.0.0 and up




### Running the Program
    1. Download repository
    2. Run ionic in command prompt with ionic serve and take note of localhost, in my case it was 4200
    3. Go to browser and navigate to the local host, in my case going to http://localhost:4200
